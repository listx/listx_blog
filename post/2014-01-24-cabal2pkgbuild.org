tags: arch, linux, haskell, cblrepo

I have open-sourced the =maintain_cblrepo.sh= script I originally
published [[file:2014-01-06-using-cblrepo-in-arch-linux.html][in this
post]]. You can find the repository
[[https://github.com/listx/cabal2pkgbuild][here]].

The script is under the BSD 2-clause license. I was thinking of putting
it in the public domain, but I think it's much easier to just use the
BSD license.[fn:1]

[fn:1] SQLite, perhaps the most influential public domain project, has a
       practice of requiring all contributors to write a statement
       explicitly declaring that they knowingly submit their
       patches/improvements into the public domain. I am too lazy to do
       the same, so BSD license it is.
