I got my two QNIX QX2710 LED Evolution II SE Matte 27" 2560x1440 Samsung
PLS WQHD monitors and incorporated them into my existing dual Acer X222W
22" 1680x1050 setup. I put the two QNIXes in the middle, and put the
Acers on the left and right edges. All four are in "portrait"
orientation, because I primarily code on my computer. A single Gigabyte
GeForce GTX 750 Ti OC 2GB GDDR5 2DVI/2HDMI card powers all four
monitors; the QNIXes use the DVI ports, while the Acers use the HDMI
ports via two HDMI-to-DVI(female) adapters. I bought this card because
of the simplicity of the four ports --- just DVI and HDMI.

As for the stands, I just bought another dual monitor stand and put it
next to my existing dual monitor stand; each stand holds a QNIX and an
Acer on each arm. The fact that the stands are subject to differently
weighted monitors (27" monitor on one arm and a 22" on another) does not
really affect them negatively. The desk in the image below is 140mm
wide, in case you want to have a sense of how tight two dual-monitor
stands would fit on your own desk.

Using four monitors sounds difficult, but it's a breeze with Xinerama
and Xmonad. The hardest part was figuring out the correct =xorg.conf=
configuration file. It was difficult because the QNIX monitors, being
cheap, do not work out of the box, because the latest Nvidia driver
(version 337.12) does not detect the correct resolution. What's worse,
the QNIXes do not support anything other than their native 2560x1440
resolution, so you'll get blank screens if you try to just use these
monitors without tweaking some =xorg.conf= settings. I actually ended up
googling to find the correct =Modeline= value for =xorg.conf= for my
QNIX, at 96hz refresh rate.[fn:1] You could try using the =cvt= program
included with =xorg-server=, but when I tried it out on my own it
generated different numbers and my QNIXes couldn't handle those numbers.

Here is my =xorg.conf=:

- i quad-monitor-portrait.xorg.conf

[fn:1] I tried using the higher refresh rate modelines, but they
       resulted in my monitors going crazy (extreme artifacting, lines
       shrieking irregularly with different colors, etc.).
