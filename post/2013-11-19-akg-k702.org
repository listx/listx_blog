I got a pair of the famous AKG K702 (manufacturer refurbished for $210)
fullsize headphones, and well, here's my review. Previously, I was using
the Nuforce NE600M (purchased new December 2012 for $30) earbuds.
Comparing these two is unfair, because they are not really designed to
compete with each other; however, I must say that I was shocked by how
much better the K702s sounded. As a side note, I only use these
headphones for my laptop/PC, and I always use the Total Bithead
headphone amp/DAC.

- Made in Austria.
- The K702s have a very large /soundstage/. This is probably because of
  the open back design --- the earcups have holes and allow some of the
  sound to leak out. I listen to a lot of classical music and this makes
  piano sonatas sound absolutely divine.
- The highs and mids are very sharp and well-defined, allowing for good
  sound separation (I can hear different instruments much more easily in
  the same song).
- The headphone cable is detachable.
- The big earpads are comfortable, and also detachable for cleaning.

* Cons

- The headband feels a little tight, and I can feel it pressing down on
  my head a little too much. Also, there is a clear plastic headband
  part on each side to secure the leather headband, but this component
  feels cheap and is prone to breakage down the line.
- It's not really a con, but the impedance is 62 ohms, which means you
  will need a dedicated headhpone amp/DAC (unless you want to turn the
  volume way up to get these headphones to really sing). If you are
  using a $200-$300 pair of headphones though, you probably already know
  about the need for a good amp/DAC combo, so that's that.

I love my K702s. Interestingly, I have gotten used to a much louder
volume with this pair of headphones than with my 600Ms. Let me explain.
I usually listen to music on medium/low, but I can now listen to loud
pop songs on high volume without any discomfort. I think it has
something to do with the bigger sound stage (open back design, plus the
way the speakers are physically further away from my eardrums).

My 600Ms don't sound as clean and awesome as they used to; for one, they
have too much bass and the sound feels very muddied, as if the sound is
coming from another room with the door closed. I had no idea that a
simple headphone upgrade could change my attitude to computer audio so
much. Unfortunately, as much as I loved the 600Ms when I first got them,
I can't really stand them now...

I strongly recommend these headphones, or another similarly-priced model
(the Beyerdynamic DT-770 is a longtime competitor) to anyone who has
never invested more than $50 on a pair of headphones. You will
definitely hear the difference, given a decent amp/DAC.
