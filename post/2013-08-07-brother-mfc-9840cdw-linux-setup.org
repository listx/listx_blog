After more than a year of struggling with my Brother printer, I finally
got it to print flawlessly. I will kindly refrain from getting into the
drama, and just write a short tutorial to set it up with CUPS in Arch
Linux.

First, install the =cups= package, as well as the Brother driver
packages in the AUR:

- =brother-cups-wrapper-ac=
- =brother-cups-wrapper-common=
- =brother-lpr-drivers-ac=
- =brother-lpr-drivers-common=

Then, enable the =cups= daemon with =systemd=, and then start it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE -n
  sudo systemctl enable cups.service
  sudo systemctl start cups.service
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now go into your favorite web browser, and go to =http://localhost:631=,
to find the CUPS web admin interface. From here, just add a new printer
using the web form buttons. When adding the printer, use the LPR/LPD
protocol, as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE -n
  lpd://IP_ADDRESS_OF_PRINTER/BINARY_P1
#+END_EXAMPLE

and use the appropriate IP address that your printer has on the network.
For the driver, select the CUPS driver for the MFC-9840CDW model (the
various Brother drivers will only appear after installing the Brother
driver packages from the AUR).

Done!
