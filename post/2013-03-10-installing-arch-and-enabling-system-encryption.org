#+STARTUP: indent showall

The following list of commands is what you need to execute in order to
set up Arch Linux with system-level encryption. The setup is 1 hard
drive with 1 100MiB =/boot= partition, with the rest as a single LVM
partition that will contain the =/= root, =/home=, and =swap=
partitions. This LVM partition will be encrypted so that when the system
boots, it will require a password to unlock the =/=, =/home=, and =swap=
partitions to boot up the system. The =/boot= partition will remain
unencrypted for the sake of simplicity.

If you are wondering why the =/home= partition is mounted on =/mnt/home=
in some of the commands, this is because the Arch Linux live CD
environment will load up a temporary Linux system onto your RAM, and we
use the =/mnt= directory (again all files/folders are temporarily in
your RAM) to mount the hard drive partitions. You can always use a live
CD anywhere to load up a barebone Linux system to your RAM and mount the
hard drives on your computer for inspection, and in such a case you will
again use the =/mnt= directory to mount your hard drives here.

If you want to look up the manpages for these commands, use =ALT+F2=,
=ALT+F3=, etc. to log into and switch between independent TTY screens.

Be sure to wipe the drive with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX
#+END_EXAMPLE

before doing anything. This way, your new Linux install will blend into
the random noise data resulting from the command above, making it
virtually impossible to detect which portions of the drive contain
actual data. If the disk you want to wipe is a secondary device to an
existing Linux installation, you can try using
[[/code.html#floop][=floop=]] to generate a faster stream of
pseudorandom bytes. With =floop=, you can just do

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  floop --threads 4 --thread-buf 0x200000 --count 0 | dd of=/dev/sdX
#+END_EXAMPLE

and it will be significantly faster than using =/dev/urandom=.
