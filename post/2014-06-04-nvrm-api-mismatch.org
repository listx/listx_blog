Sometimes when you do a system upgrade on Arch, Xorg will die on a
reboot and you'll get this kernel error (available with =dmesg=):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE -n
  NVRM: API mismatch: the client has the version XXX.XX, but
  NVRM: this kernel module has the version YYY.YY.  Please
  NVRM: make sure that this kernel module and all NVIDIA driver
  NVRM: components have the same version.
#+END_EXAMPLE

. This is usually the case when you upgrade your =linux= package,
followed by upgrading your =nvidia= package. The problem is that the new
kernel image references your older =nvidia= package (when it executed
=mkinitcpio -p linux= before =nvidia= got upgraded). There are two
possible solutions:

1) Simply remake your kernel image against your newly upgraded =nvidia=
   package. Run =mkinitcpio -p linux= again, and reboot.
2) In the alternative, downgrade to your previous set of =nvidia=
   drivers, located in =/var/cache/pacman/pkg/=.

Hope this helps someone out there. =)
