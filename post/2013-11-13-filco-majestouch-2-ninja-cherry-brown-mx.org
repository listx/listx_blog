I got the Majestouch 2 Ninja (model FKBN104M/EFB2) a few weeks ago and
have been enjoying it as my main keyboard. I like it very much and
highly recommend it. I will keep this review short and simple.

* Pros
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: pros
   :END:

- I love the fact that this keyboard has front-face printing on the
  keycaps --- i.e., the letters and words are printed not directly on
  the keycaps themselves, but on the side of the keycap facing you, so
  that, they are visible only if you look at the keyboard from the
  viewpoint of the user. I thought I was taking a bit of a gamble with
  these uniquely printed keycaps, but I find them just perfect for the
  touch typist such as myself. Also, I usually put the keyboard at least
  a feet or so away from me[fn:1] and it's actually /easier/ to see the
  keys than with a regular keyboard!
- Solid construction; keyboard is heavy.
- Inconspicuous branding/logo.

* Cons

- The Enter key, if you put your finger on it and wiggle your finger
  left to right, produces a clicking noise from the keycap touching the
  metal lever underneath it. It feels a bit awkward, although in
  practice it doesn't really change the feel of the keyboard at all,
  because, when you do use the Enter key, you just press it like any
  other key.
- USB cable is not detachable.
- USB cable comes directly out the center of the keyboard --- you cannot
  reposition it to come out from the left or right.

* Conclusion

I love this keyboard. I love the feel of the Cherry Brown switch. The
feel is like a cross between a Topre and a buckling spring --- soft, yet
mechanical. The keys have enough resistance so that I can rest my
fingers on the keys without fearing that I'll register a keypress (a
problem I had with the 45g Topre switches). I might try out the Cherry
Clear MX switches in the future (maybe when the CODE keyboard gets
restocked).

[fn:1] I have long arms.
