title: Find Lines with 80+ Columns in Multiple Files
tags: linux, programming
---

It's nice to follow the 80-columns-per-line rule[fn:1], but what if you
have some lingering project that has yet to conform?

Just go to that project's sources directory and do

- i find-80-cols.sh

.

The call to =expand= is necessary because different people use different
widths for tabs. That is, we are trying to find files with 80+ /columns/
(as they appear to humans), not 80+ /characters/ (as they appear to the
computer).

       Kernel Coding Style]], "Chapter 2: Breaking long lines and
       strings".
