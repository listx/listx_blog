## Motivation

I recently purchased an ErgoDox keyboard[^ergo-arrival], and I've been thinking about creating my own keyboard layout in the spirit of the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard layout (DSK).
One of the guiding principles of DSK was putting an emphasis on reducing finger travel by identifying the most commonly occurring letters of the English language, and placing them on the home row of the keyboard.
Now, the Dvorak layout was patented in 1936 according to Wikipedia, with subsequent adjustments culminating in the present form of DSK.

I want to find out for myself what letters are the most common.
Sure, I could blindly trust an online source like Wikipedia, but it just feels like an easy problem to solve.
Also, I am not sure if Dvorak considered *word* frequency as well as *letter* frequency.
Ideally, one should use the data of both word and letter frequency to determine what is the most commonly typed "letter" on a US ASCII keyboard for English writers.

## The Problems

### Letter Frequency

Write a program that reads a file (plaintext) and counts how many times each letter occurs in the file.
You must treat `A` as the same letter as `a`.
You may limit yourself to the plain US ASCII 26-letter alphabet, discarding all letters with diacritics.
Sort the letters by their frequence; for each letter, display the letter itself, its relative frequency percentage to the file as a whole, and the number of times this letter appears (raw count).
E.g., the letter `a` counted by this program might look like this: `a = 2.00% (200 occurrences)`.

### Word Frequency

Write a program that reads a file (plaintext) and counts how many times each *word* occurs in the file.
The precise definition of a "word" is up to you, but you must exclude arabic numerals and also standalone punctuation characters (e.g., "* is not a word").
Display the 100 most common words in similar fashion to the Letter Frequency problem.

Both the letter and word frequency problems will use the Project Gutenberg plaintext file of [*Moby Dick*](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701.txt).

Now, before you go on to read my solutions, I encourage you to write a solution on your own using your favorite programming language.

### Letter Frequency

The `freq_l` method views letters in the limited US ASCII range and uses crude, C-like letter-to-integer equivalence via `char_to_idx`.
We use a simple array of 26 integers, each one corresponding to a letter.
But thanks to its stupidity, `freq_l` runs quite fast --- chugging through Moby Dick in a few seconds on my Core i7-4770K 4GHz machine.

### Word Frequency

The `freq_w` method relies almost entirely on a single regex, `/\W*\s\W*/`, to split the input into words.
These words are further processed; we perform a basic sanity check with the `/\w/` regex to make sure we are not dealing with just numbers or punctuation, and we also take into account the em dash `--`.
We use a basic hash structure to store the words as keys, and their counts as values.

### Letter Frequency

`freqL` handles letter frequency, and it is a simple `foldl` operation over the input, while using the `Map` data structure from the `Data.Map` library (which acts as a simple hash structure with keys and values).
The de facto Haskell compiler GHC comes with the `base` library which includes the `Data.Char` module; unlike Ruby, we can simply ask whether a character is a letter with `isAlpha`, and then use `toLower` on it to convert it to lowercase.
`freqL` owes its brevity to these standard library functions.

Thanks to these standard library functions, we can easily keep track of more than just the basic 26 alphabetical letters (although in the case of *Moby Dick*, there does not seem to be any such characters).

### Word Frequency

This is probably a convoluted way to keep track of words.
I did not opt for using regular expressions, because I wanted to try out a different approach instead of just translating the Ruby solution.
I could have used the excellent Parsec library, but I just felt like rolling my own solution.

`freqW` works by looking at just one character at a time, just like `freqL`.
It also keeps track of the evaluation of the previously-looked-at character, with the `wfsm` variable (for *Word Finite State Machine*, a fancy but still pertinent name).
`wfsm` can either say that the last character made us go *in* a word (`WordIn`), *out* of a word for sure (`WordOut`), or possibly out of a word (`WordOutMaybe`).
Depending on the status of `wfsm` and the current character, `freqW` makes various choices.

Now, this mechanism isn't without its warts.
But still, I consider it somewhat elegant in its description of all possible states.

## A Diff

For fun, let's look at the diff of the outputs of the Ruby and Haskell versions.
Interestingly, the letter frequency outputs were identical.
The word frequency outputs did have some significant changes, such as the word *whale* occurring 972 and 1108 times in the Ruby and Haskell versions, respectively.
I've sorted the output by lines for saner diffing.

.
The most common French word in this book is *de*, meaning *of* in English.
This is because the word for *the* is split into many different words, most notably *la* and *le*, not to mention *l'* as in *l'homme* (as you can see near the end of the list), due to the French language's gender and vowel contraction rules (unlike English, contractions like *l'homme* in French are mandatory regardless of tone).

And, as a bit of trivia, it is interesting to note that *dieu* (God) edges out *l'homme* (man) by 7 occurrences in this text.

## Conclusion

I hope you've had some fun working on these letter and word frequency problems.
The word frequency problem, if you really want to do it correctly, should be handled by a parser using a robust library.
By writing these programs, I learned that the *input* of a program (Unicode? ASCII only?) is just as important as its output.

Happy hacking!
