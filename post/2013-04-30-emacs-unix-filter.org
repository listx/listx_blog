In Vim, you can easily call an external text utility on a region of
text, then replace that selected region with the output of the text
utility. This is very useful for doing bulk transformations quickly.

I coded up a very stupid commenting program called
[[https://github.com/listx/nox][=nox=]] that comments/uncomments text.
Here is how you'd use it straight from the terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n
  $ echo "hi" | nox -l c
  //hi
#+END_SRC

By default nox comments text, and the =-l c= option sets it to C-styled
comments, =//=.

I use [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][evil-mode]] with Emacs.
Here is my relevant =.emacs= to set up =nox= correctly:

- i emacs-unix-filter.el

This is certainly not the most beautiful code, but it works.
