Hello!
My name is Linus Arver and this is my blog.
You can visit my [LinkedIn][linkedin] page to see what I'm up to professionally, although probably [Github][github] is more direct.

Please email me at [linus@ucla.edu](mailto:linus@ucla.edu) for anything related to this blog.
I have long since graduated from UCLA, but they gave me a lifetime email address. Thank you, UCLA!

# On Programming

I have fun writing computer programs.
It is by far my favorite hobby, ever since I rediscovered it in 2009.
There's just something about making the computer solve your problems that just never gets old...!

I originally started a blog about various programming-related things [here][old-blog], but I wanted more control over how the content is generated/stored, and so I created this site.

# Recommended Software

I use free/open-source software almost exclusively as much as possible.
Below are some of them.

- [NixOS][nixos] - my favorite OS
- [Terminus][terminus] - my favorite monospaced font
- [alacritty][alacritty] - a modern terminal
- [Xmonad][xmonad] - the crash-proof tiled window manager
- [Vim][vim] - an advanced text editor
- [Emacs][emacs] - an even more advanced text editor
- [evil][evil] - an Emacs addon that makes it behave like Vim
- [Qutebrowser][qutebrowser] - a lightweight browser with Vim bindings
- [Texlive][texlive] - the modern TeX environment (LuaTeX being my preferred engine)
