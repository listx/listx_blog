Hello!
My name is Linus Arver and this is my blog.

Please email me at [linus@ucla.edu](mailto:linus@ucla.edu) for anything related to this blog.
I have long since graduated from UCLA, but they gave me a lifetime email address. ;)

# Programming

My [Github](https://github.com/listx).

I have fun writing computer programs.
It is by far my favorite hobby.
I like C, Python, and Haskell; I know some Emacs Lisp because of necessity (as it is my editor of choice).

# Recommended Software

I use free/open-source software almost exclusively as much as possible.
Below are some of them.

- [NixOS][nixos] - my favorite OS
- [dm-crypt/LUKS][crypto] - my choice for full disk encryption
- [Terminus][terminus] - my favorite monospaced font
- [rxvt-unicode][urxvt] (aka `urxvt`) - the only sane Unicode-aware terminal emulator
- [Xmonad][xmonad] - the crash-proof tiled window manager
- [Vim][vim] - an advanced text editor
- [Emacs][emacs] - an even more advanced text editor
- [evil][evil] - an Emacs addon that makes it behave like Vim
- [git][git] - distributed data versioning
- [GnuPG][gpg] (aka `gpg`) - a way to ensure secure communications
- [Qutebrowser][qb] - a lightweight browser that makes it behave like Vim
- [Texlive][texlive] - the modern TeX environment (LuaTeX being my preferred engine)
- [Lilypond][lily] - if TeX is the sophisticated typesetting system, then Lilypond is the sophisticated sheet-music-setting system
