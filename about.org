Hello!
My name is Linus Arver and this is my blog.
Please email me at [[mailto:linus@ucla.edu][linus@ucla.edu]] for anything related to this blog.
I have long since graduated from UCLA, but they gave me a lifetime email address. Thank you, UCLA!

* On Programming

I have fun writing computer programs.
It is by far my favorite hobby, ever since I rediscovered it in 2009.
There's just something about making the computer solve your problems that just never gets old...!

I originally started a blog about various programming-related things [[https://zuttobenkyou.wordpress.com/][here]], but I wanted more control over how the content is generated/stored, and so I created this site.

* Recommended Software

I use free/open-source software almost exclusively as much as possible.
Below are some of them.

- [[https://nixos.org][NixOS]] - my favorite OS
- [[http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/][Terminus]] - my favorite bitmapped monospaced font

- [[http://xmonad.org/][xmonad]] - the crash-proof tiled window manager

- [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs][Emacs]] - an even more advanced text editor
- [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][Evil]] - an Emacs addon that makes it behave like Vim
