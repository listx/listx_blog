title: Papers & Slides

Here is a list of more serious work.
"Serious" here means anything that took me more than a few sittings to write and revise, as anything that takes less than that would most likely just get uploaded as a blog post.

# Papers

## Bitscans and De Bruijn Sequences (2014)

I wrote this paper originally in 2011--2012, but it was not released until it was finally revised in 2014.

# Slides

## Git: Your Favorite Tool (July 2015)

These slides are from a talk I gave internally at [Twin Prime](https://twinprime.com/).
I designed the slides so that they are readable as-is, without a real presentation.
Last but not least, I hereby release these slides into the Public Domain --- do whatever you like with them!
